# Holographic Playground

This is a sample repository for learning how different 3D tools interact with the HoloLens.  It's mostly for my own benefit.

## MonoGame

Not working yet.

## UrhoSharp

Also not working yet

## Other tools

I'm fairly new to 3D so if you know of anything else I should be trying out, let me know.
